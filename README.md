# react-tic-tac-toe-hooks
React Tic Tac Toe Game using Functional Components and Hooks
This was based off a react tutorial by https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDCHcqyeQgJ-jVSd6VJkbCw 
I added some features but this was mainly used to learn the basics of react.
Im looking foward to learning to make more complex react apps in the near future


Features:
- Basic Tic Tac Toe
- History of moves
- Winner Detection
- Restart Game
